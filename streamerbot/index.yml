    First off, **thank you** to everyone who has been using this bot, providing feedback (i.e. breaking it üòÅ), and being supportive of my efforts to just provide another option for streamers out there to use.
    <br><br>
    A very big thank you to the amazing folks who have been supporting me through the hectic release:

    **I appreciate all the support from everyone and to all using this software. Thank you.**
