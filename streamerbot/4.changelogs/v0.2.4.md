## Details
### YouTube
The YouTube integration no longer relies on the Google libraries, that's 5 fewer DLLs being supplied with Streamer.bot moving forward. However, these DLLs will be left alone if they are already present in your Streamer.bot folder.

Also moving forward, YouTube will only need 1 main scope to function. Because of the scope mis-match, it will ask to re-authenticate when you start Streamer.bot.
#### Multi Broadcast Support
Here is an update I've had cooking for a while. Streamer.bot now supports handling multiple YouTube broadcasts.

Setting a title and/or a description for a broadcast will not work outside of the UI. The reason for this, need to figure out how to generically pick a broadcast, since it is not possible to create an action that would be re-used for future broadcasts.

The send message methods have been updated, and will send a message to any broadcast that is currently being monitored. Also, the sub-action has been updated with a drop down to pick a broadcast, this will let you choose all, latest, or from variable. The variable option will use a variable that is set by YouTube events that indicate which broadcast they came from, and will send the message only to that broadcast.

Once you're logged into `YouTube`, the `Broadcasts` tab will be populated with your **20** most recent broadcasts. You can right click on a broadcast, and pick `Monitor` to start monitoring it. There is also a setting under Settings, to `Auto Monitor Live Broadcasts`. `Broadcasts` will not be auto monitored unless you either explicitly set it to, or enable auto for live broadcasts. Completed broadcasts can **not** be monitored.
#### Events
It has come to my attention that certain events were not triggering, after some searching and testing, it appears that some events just flat out do not work.

The following YouTube triggers will never work until `YouTube` adds the data to the `API`.
* Message Deleted
* Message Retracted
* YouTube Polls
The last 2 do not exist as triggers yet, but wanted to make note of them.
### Updating
The upgrade code was starting to get a bit unruly, and unnecessary to keep bringing forward, so, starting with `0.2.4`, the **minimum** version supported for upgrading is `0.2.0`. The auto-updater has already been updated, so anyone below `0.2.0` will be presented with `0.2.0` as an available update, and anyone on `0.2.0` or higher, will be presented with the latest.
### Twitch
#### New Scopes
The following scopes are required on the broadcaster account now, these supoport the move from PubSub events to EventSub events
* user:read:emotes
* moderator:manage:unban_requests
* moderator:read:moderators
* moderator:read:vips
* moderator:read:suspicious_users
* moderator:manage:warnings
#### PubSub
It was mentioned in the last TwitchDev broadcast, that sometime in the near future PubSub would be deprecated. So starting with this alpha, I have moved a good majority of the events that rely on PubSub over to there counterparts on EventSub.

#### IMPORTANT
Take note, there are breaking changes with the update to EventSub for some events, specifically for those that rely on Streamer.bot's websocket messages.

This will affect the following events:
* Timeout
* Untimeout
* Ban
* Unban
* Clear Chat
* Moderator Add
* Moderator Remove
* VIP Add
* VIP Remove

There are 4 events still left on PubSub, and they are:
* Ad Midroll
* Viewer Count Update
* Community Goal Contribution
* Community Goal Ended

The 2 community goal events do not have an equivalent in EventSub (yet), these goals are the channel point based goals, which seem to be overlooked by Twitch.

The Ad Midroll event will likely be going away, and I will expand the new Ad event that was introduced in 0.2.3.

The Viewer Count Update event has no EventSub counterpart, so this will require other means to obtain, but may not be as accurate.
#### Auto Reward Redemptions
These rewards, are the 5 fixed ones that you can enable/disable in your channel points.

These rewards are also now being tracked in the twitch data db.

Before it's asked, no, you can not enable/disable them from SB, as there are no API endpoints to do this as of this version.
#### Sub and ReSub Triggers
Twith Sub and Resub events now have 3 new variable, `isMultiMonth`, `multiMonthDuration` and `multiMonthTenure`
#### New Sub-actions
* Reward Set Max Per Stream
* Reward Set Max Per User Per Stream
#### New C# Methods
```cs
bool TwitchApproveAutoHeldMessage(string messageId);
bool TwitchDenyAutoHeldMessage(string messageId);
```
```cs
TwitchWarnUser(string userName, string reason);
```
```cs
void UpdateRewardMaxPerStream(string rewardId, long redeems, bool additive = false);
void UpdateRewardMaxPerUserPerStream(string rewardId, long redeems, bool additive = false);
```
### OBS
OBS handling in `0.2.4` received a little bit of TLC.

With the issues surrounding users deleting and recreating OBS connections, thus severing the link sub-actions had to the connection, I've expanded the usage of the `Default` connection for OBS.

Prior to `0.2.4`, you could mark an `OBS Connection` as `Default`, and this would be used when you `Import` actions that contain `OBS sub-actions`, it would set them to use whatever is configured as default, and I'm pretty sure most weren't aware of this, or used it.

So, starting with `0.2.4`, the `Default` connection has more meaning now.

First up, all sub-actions have a new entry you can pick in the connection drop down, `Default`, this will mean the sub-action uses whatever is configured as `Default`, this has also been applied to Triggers

Since this is an underlying change, a configuration upgrade will be performed, and the following will happen:
* OBS Connections will be moved to there own json file
* If there is only 1 connection, and it's not marked as `Default`, it will be marked as `Default`
* If there are multiple connections, and none are marked as `Default`, then the first connection in the list will be marked as `Default`
* **All** OBS Sub-actions will be updated, if there connection does not exist, or if the connection matches the `Default`, it will be changed to `Default` from the specific one
* **All** OBS Triggers will be updated, using the same criteria as sub-actions, and those with Any will be left alone

When you add and delete OBS Connections, if you remove them all, and add a new one, it will automatically be marked as `Default`. If you remove the `Default` connection, then the first connection will automatically be marked.
### HypeRate.io
HypeRate added a new feature to auto clip on Twitch, and the new event is related to this, it only triggers when HypeRate itself has created a clip.

THIS IS NOT an event for whenever a Twitch Clip is created, that does not exist in Twitch's EventSub/API capabilities at the moment.
### Pally.gg
`Pally.gg` is now supported!

In order to setup `Pally.gg`, you will need an API Key from there website. You can get this from your dashboard.

#### Triggers Added
* Connected
* Disconnected
* Campaign Tip
### Audio Service
With `0.2.4`, you can now **stop** all playing sounds, or a playing sound. Yes, you heard that right, you can now **stop** sounds that have been started in **Streamer.bot**

2 new sub-actions have been added:
* Stop All Sound Playback
* Stop Sound Playback
The first sub-action, `Stop All Sound Playback` does just that, it will stop any sound that has been started with the `Play Sound`, `Play Sound From Folder` or equivalent C# methods. Be sure to add this sub-action in a **different queue** then your sounds, or in in a non-blocking queue.

The `Play Sound` and `Play Sound From Folder` have received new properties, `Name`, and `Use FileName as Name`. By default, `Name` is empty, and `Use FileName as Name` is true.

The Name field can contain one of 4 values:
* Leaving it empty will use a **"default"** name
* Entering your own value into is, such as **"specialSound"**
* Using a `variable`, this field will parse the `variable`, but if it's unable to, it will be the `variable` itself
* If `Use FileName as Name` is enabled, then it will be the file name **without** the extension.

The second sub-action, `Stop Sound Playback` will let you stop a specific sound, by `name`. As outlined above, the `name` you want to use here, is what you set in the `Name` field in the `Play Sound` or `Play Sound from Folder` sub-action. This will stop all sounds that have this name.

Both of these sub-actions, if stopping a sound that you're waiting to complete, will return the duration of how long it played for.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
Any existing `Play Sound` and `Play Sound From Folder` sub-actions will default to `Use FileName as Name`, this means, if the file you are playing is `some-random-sound.mp3`, then it's name will be `some-random-sound`
::
#### New C# Methods
```cs
void StopAllSoundPlayback();
void StopSoundPlayback(string soundName);
```
Updated C# Play Sound methods
```cs
double PlaySound(string fileName, float volume = 1.0f, bool finishBeforeContinuing = false, string name = null, bool useFileName = true);
double PlaySoundFromFolder(string path, float volume = 1.0f, bool recursive = false, bool finishBeforeContinuing = false, string name = null, bool useFileName = true);
```
### VoiceMod
With the release of **Streamer.bot 0.2.4**, the `VoiceMod` integration will now require a **minimum version** of `2.51`

This requirement was put in place to simplify some of the VoiceMod code, and overall to improve it.
#### New Triggers
* Connected
* Disconnected
* Voice Loaded
* Soundboard Changed
### Commands
With this release, command counters have been moved to there own database. This allows for greater control and flexibility. Existing counters are converted over to the new database if they are persisted.

#### New C# Methods
```cs
int CommandGetCounter(string commandId);
CommandCounter CommandGetUserCounter(string userLogin, Platform platform, string commandId);
CommandCounter CommandGetUserCounterById(string userId, Platform platform, string commandId);
```
`CommandCounter` class
```cs
public class CommandCounter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public string UserLogin { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Platform { get; set; }
    public int Count { get; set; }
    public int Source { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastUsed { get; set; }
}
```
```cs
void CommandResetCounter(string commandId);
void CommandResetAllUserCounters(string commandId);
void CommandResetUsersCounters(string userId, Platform platform, bool persisted);
void CommandResetUserCounter(string commandId, string userId, Platform platform);
```
### Streamer.bot Website
The interop between the website and the application got a bit of a boost with 2 new features!

Remote Triggers, and Remote Signaling

For both of these features to function, while in alpha, `0.2.4-alpha.5` is the minimum required version for `Triggers`, and `0.2.4-alpha.6` for `Signals`.

This feature **REQUIRES** both instances of **Streamer.bot** to have the `Website Integration` connected.

#### Remote Triggers
You can now send a trigger to another instance of Streamer.bot that is logged into your account.

Much like the C# activate trigger, you are able to add a **Streamer.bot** Remote Instance Trigger trigger to an action, and specify any or a specific origin instance, as well as the custom name for the event. In another copy of **Streamer.bot**, you can use the **Streamer.bot** Remote Instance Trigger sub-action, to trigger that remote trigger.

You can also see an event history on the website under your settings, with the ability to replay triggers from there.

#### Remote Signals
You are now able to wait for signals sent by other instances.

There are 2 new sub-actions added:
* Send Remote Signal
* Wait For Remote Signal

The premise behind these 2 sub-actions is a way to communicate with another remote instance of **Streamer.bot**.

#### Send Signal
This will allow you to send a named signal, with or without arguments to either all, or a specific Streamer.bot Instance

#### Wait For Signal
This sub-action will, as the name implies, wait for a named signal from any or a specific Streamer.bot instance up to a specified timeout (default 30s), consume the arguments it received, and carry on with the rest of the action.

### Run Action Sub-action
This sub-action has received a custom runtime menu item, Goto Action

### Read Random Line from File
This sub-action has been updated to include an option to Overwrite Existing Variable(s)

If this is enabled, the variables added to the action, will always start at 0, and overwrite any existing.

### Local Signals
Signals have been added for the local instance of Streamer.bot, these behave the same way as there Remote counter parts, but, are meant for local usage.

### Shortcut Keys
I've gone through and hopefully fixed shortcut key, and also added a few new ones.

#### Global Keys Available
* `F1` - Launch https://docs.streamer.bot/
* `Ctrl + S` - Save
* `Ctrl + Alt + I` - Open Import Dialog
* `Ctrl + Alt + E` - Open Export Dialog
* `Ctrl + Alt + C` - Open Chat
* `Ctrl + Alt + V` - Open Variable Viewer
* `Ctrl + L` - Open your Log Folder

Actions, Sub-Actions, Triggers, Commands, Timed Actions, MIDI In/Out, MIDI Events, and Quotes all have shortcut keys as well.
### Throwing System
This release received 2 new sub-actions
* Throw Items
* Throw Items By Name
These sub-actions will let you throw multiple items in one sub-action
### New C# Methods
Added the following C# Methods for Incrementing a global variable
```cs
void IncrementAllTwitchUsersVar(string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementTwitchUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementAllYouTubeUsersVar(string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementYouTubeUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementAllTrovoUsersVar(string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementTrovoUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementOrCreateTwitchUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementOrCreateYouTubeUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementOrCreateTrovoUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
```
Added the following C# Methods for enabling/disabling an action
```cs
void DisableActionById(string actionId);
void EnableActionById(string actionId);
```
Added the following C# Methods for groups
```cs
List<string> GetGroups();
