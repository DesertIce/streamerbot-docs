## Details
### Twitch
#### New Scopes
The following scopes are required on the broadcaster account now, these supoport the move from PubSub events to EventSub events
* user:read:emotes
* moderator:manage:unban_requests
* moderator:read:moderators
* moderator:read:vips
#### PubSub
It was mentioned in the last TwitchDev broadcast, that sometime in the near future PubSub would be deprecated. So starting with this alpha, I have moved a good majority of the events that rely on PubSub over to there counterparts on EventSub.

#### IMPORTANT
Take note, there are breaking changes with the update to EventSub for some events, specifically for those that rely on Streamer.bot's websocket messages.

This will affect the following events:
* Timeout
* Untimeout
* Ban
* Unban
* Clear Chat
* Moderator Add
* Moderator Remove
* VIP Add
* VIP Remove

There are 4 events still left on PubSub, and they are:
* Ad Midroll
* Viewer Count Update
* Community Goal Contribution
* Community Goal Ended

The 2 community goal events do not have an equivalent in EventSub (yet), these goals are the channel point based goals, which seem to be overlooked by Twitch.

The Ad Midroll event will likely be going away, and I will expand the new Ad event that was introduced in 0.2.3.

The Viewer Count Update event has no EventSub counterpart, so this will require other means to obtain, but may not be as accurate.
#### Auto Reward Redemptions
These rewards, are the 5 fixed ones that you can enable/disable in your channel points.

These rewards are also now being tracked in the twitch data db.

Before it's asked, no, you can not enable/disable them from SB, as there are no API endpoints to do this as of this version.
### HypeRate.io
HypeRate added a new feature to auto clip on Twitch, and the new event is related to this, it only triggers when HypeRate itself has created a clip.

THIS IS NOT an event for whenever a Twitch Clip is created, that does not exist in Twitch's EventSub/API capabilities at the moment.
### Pally.gg
`Pally.gg` is now supported!

In order to setup `Pally.gg`, you will need an API Key from there website. You can get this from your dashboard.

#### Triggers Added
* Connected
* Disconnected
* Campaign Tip

### Commands
With this release, command counters have been moved to there own database. This allows for greater control and flexibility. Existing counters are converted over to the new database if they are persisted.

#### New C# Methods
```cs
int CommandGetCounter(string commandId);
CommandCounter CommandGetUserCounter(string userLogin, string platform, string commandId);
CommandCounter CommandGetUserCounterById(string userId, string platform, string commandId);
```
`CommandCounter` class
```cs
public class CommandCounter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public string UserLogin { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Platform { get; set; }
    public int Count { get; set; }
    public int Source { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastUsed { get; set; }
}
```

### Streamer.bot Website
The interop between the website and the application got a bit of a boost with 2 new features!

Remote Triggers, and Remote Signaling

For both of these features to function, while in alpha, `0.2.4-alpha.5` is the minimum required version for `Triggers`, and `0.2.4-alpha.6` for `Signals`.

This feature **REQUIRES** both instances of **Streamer.bot** to have the `Website Integration` connected.

#### Remote Triggers
You can now send a trigger to another instance of Streamer.bot that is logged into your account.

Much like the C# activate trigger, you are able to add a **Streamer.bot** Remote Instance Trigger trigger to an action, and specify any or a specific origin instance, as well as the custom name for the event. In another copy of **Streamer.bot**, you can use the **Streamer.bot** Remote Instance Trigger sub-action, to trigger that remote trigger.

You can also see an event history on the website under your settings, with the ability to replay triggers from there.

#### Remote Signals
You are now able to wait for signals sent by other instances.

There are 2 new sub-actions added:
* Send Remote Signal
* Wait For Remote Signal

The premise behind these 2 sub-actions is a way to communicate with another remote instance of **Streamer.bot**.

#### Send Signal
This will allow you to send a named signal, with or without arguments to either all, or a specific Streamer.bot Instance

#### Wait For Signal
This sub-action will, as the name implies, wait for a named signal from any or a specific Streamer.bot instance up to a specified timeout (default 30s), consume the arguments it received, and carry on with the rest of the action.

### Run Action Sub-action
This sub-action has received a custom runtime menu item, Goto Action

### Read Random Line from File
This sub-action has been updated to include an option to Overwrite Existing Variable(s)

If this is enabled, the variables added to the action, will always start at 0, and overwrite any existing.

### Local Signals
Signals have been added for the local instance of Streamer.bot, these behave the same way as there Remote counter parts, but, are meant for local usage.

### Shortcut Keys
I've gone through and hopefully fixed shortcut key, and also added a few new ones.

#### Global Keys Available
* `F1` - Launch https://docs.streamer.bot/
* `Ctrl + S` - Save
* `Ctrl + Alt + I` - Open Import Dialog
* `Ctrl + Alt + E` - Open Export Dialog
* `Ctrl + Alt + C` - Open Chat
* `Ctrl + Alt + V` - Open Variable Viewer
* `Ctrl + L` - Open your Log Folder

Actions, Sub-Actions, Triggers, Commands, Timed Actions, MIDI In/Out, MIDI Events, and Quotes all have shortcut keys as well.

### New C# Methods
Added the following C# Methods for Twitch Auto Mod
```cs
bool TwitchApproveAutoHeldMessage(string messageId);
bool TwitchDenyAutoHeldMessage(string messageId);
```
Added the following C# Methods for Incrementing a global variable

void IncrementOrCreateTwitchUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementOrCreateYouTubeUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementOrCreateTrovoUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
```
Added the following C# Methods for enabling/disabling an action
```cs
void DisableActionById(string actionId);
void EnableActionById(string actionId);
```
Added the following C# Methods for groups
```cs
List<string> GetGroups();
bool GroupExists(string groupName);
bool DeleteGroup(string groupName);
bool AddGroup(string groupName);
```

```
