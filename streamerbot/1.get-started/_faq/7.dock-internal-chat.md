description: Can I dock the internal Streamer.bot chat to OBS?
---

You can dock the internal chat in **read-only** mode by enabling the Streamer.bot WebSocket Server and adding the following URLs as Custom Browser Docks in OBS:

- Streamer.bot Chat: `https://chat.streamer.bot/feed/chat`
- Streamer.bot Event Feed: `https://chat.streamer.bot/feed/events`

The ability to **send messages** is coming in Streamer.bot v0.2.5, currently in public beta.
Check out the [#beta-releases](<https://discord.com/channels/834650675224248362/989593865013055648/1294689469156425880>) channel with the Beta Tester role for more info. There is no ETA on the full release yet.

Alternatively, there are also some OBS plugins which enable docking of external windows:
1. [Window Dock](<https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/window-dock.2005/>)
2. [Source Dock](<https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-dock.1317/>) (read only)
