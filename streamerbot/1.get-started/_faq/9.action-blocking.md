description: How do I prevent my actions from overlapping/running multiple times at once?

Go into the *Action Queues* tab, then into *Queues* and create a new queue (`Rightclick -> Add`). Give it any name you like and check *Blocking*. Now go back into your *Actions* tab and assign the queue to all the actions you want in there by editing the action (Doubeclick the action or Rightclick -> Edit). Now the upcoming actions will only start running once the previous one has finished.
