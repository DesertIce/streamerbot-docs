description: How do I know which variables are available?

The easiest way would be to check out <https://docs.streamer.bot/> and look for the trigger or subaction you are using. A full list of variables will be given there, e.g. [*Twitch Follow* trigger](<https://docs.streamer.bot/api/triggers/twitch/channel/follow>). A second method would be to run the action, then go into the *Action Queues* tab, into the *Action History* and then doubleclick the action that has run. This will give you all variables that have been populated. (Example: [see here](<https://i.imgur.com/sc2Mo41.png>))
