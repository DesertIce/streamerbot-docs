description: Why is my Streamer.bot not connecting to OBS?
---
This can have various reasons. First of all make sure that *Enable WebSocket server* is checked in OBS. If Streamer.bot and OBS are running on the same PC, use `127.0.0.1` as the IP, otherwise make sure the Server IP matches. Port and password have to match aswell, if on the same network you can also just deactivate authentification. In rare cases the default port `4455` is already occupied, in that case try to change it to something else, like `4456` or `1234`. Last but not least make sure to choose `v5.x` on the connection in Streamer.bot.
