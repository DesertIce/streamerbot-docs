description: Can I use math in a subaction?
---

Yes, for most cases you will need a *Set Argument* subaction (`Core -> Arguments -> Set Argument`). In there you can use [inline functions](/guide/variables#inline-functions). Choose any variable name and then do the math in the *Value* field. If you wanted to convert seconds to milliseconds to then use it in a delay subaction, you can do it like this: `$math(%secondsVariable% * 1000)$`. Simply use the newly named variable in a *Delay* subaction afterwards. (Example: [see here](<https://i.imgur.com/8RoLBgN.png>))
