- [Kick](https://kick.com) and [TikTok](https://tiktok.com) support will be considered if/when they release a public API.
  - Kick API has been announced, but release date is currently unknown
  - TikTok API support is unknown at this time, but a Streamer.bot integration is available by [TikFinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/streamerbot-integration)

For other platforms, if there is already a public API available, please let us know at [Streamer.bot Ideas & Suggestions](https://ideas.streamer.bot)
