## Details
### Twitch
Updating to EventSub, and just cleaning up in general, new scopes are required on your account.
* `user:read:chat`
* `user:read:whispers`
* `moderator:read:warnings`

With the removal of `PubSub` Twitch Community Goal events will no longer function, these are the `GoalContribution` and `GoalFinished` events. For whatever reason, `Twitch` has not brough these events forward to EventSub, and there is no other means of handling them atm.
